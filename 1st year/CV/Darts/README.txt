
1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

Example:

numpy==1.22.4
opencv_python==4.6.0
scikit_image==0.19.3
cvzone==1.5.6

2. how to run each task and where to look for the output file.

Example:

Task 1:
script:run task1.py
The path to the folder containing the images for task1 should be specified in variable called path_test_data
This script creates the Iordachescu_Anca_407 folder
output: the output is inside Iordachescu_Anca_407/Task1

Task 2:run task2.py
The path to the folder containing the images for task2 should be specified in variable called path_test_data
output: the output is inside Iordachescu_Anca_407/Task2

Task 3:run task3.py
The path to the folder containing the images for task3 should be specified in variable called path_test_data
output: the output is inside Iordachescu_Anca_407/Task3
